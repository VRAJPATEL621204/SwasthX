## 🩺 Project Overview

**SwasthX** is a next-generation health-tech execution monitoring dashboard developed as part of the **AarogyaID** initiative. It is designed to bring visibility, efficiency, and simplicity to the document execution and review workflow in healthcare or diagnostics environments.

At its core, SwasthX combines a clean and **visually appealing interface** with **robust backend services**, offering a full-stack solution for managing and monitoring document statuses in real-time.

### ✨ Highlights:

- 🔄 **Dynamic User Interface**: The platform features a beautifully animated and highly responsive home page with **arrow-based visual guides** that direct user attention, enhancing navigation and experience.
  
- 📄 **Monitor Dashboard**: A powerful dashboard that showcases all document executions in a neatly formatted and **paginated table** view. Each document includes details like:
  - Execution ID
  - File Name & Type
  - Start & End Time
  - Review Status
  - Environment type (dev/prod)

- 📊 **Live Overview Cards**: At the top of the dashboard, color-coded status cards provide a real-time snapshot of documents in **Pending**, **Completed**, and **Rejected** states—ideal for monitoring workflow progress.

- 🖱️ **Interactive Sidebar Navigation**: Minimalist and icon-based sidebar for easy access, complete with a user profile avatar at the bottom.

- ♻️ **Live Refresh with Timestamps**: Monitor data is auto-updatable via a refresh button that also displays the last update time.

This project was built not only to demonstrate modern full-stack development but also to showcase a real-world health-monitoring system prototype that is scalable, maintainable, and UI-driven.
